# Contact-book-application-with-tkinter
Based on a mini "hackathon" topic in class. Decided to work on this as a portfolio and use it as an opportunity to be familiar with tkinter package/GUI. 


## Objective: Develop a console-based contact book application where users can:
- Add, search, update, and delete contact information.
- Use dictionaries to store contact details, lists to aggregate contacts, and functions for the Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations.

## Key Concepts:
- Dictionaries for storing individual contact details (e.g., name, email, phone number)
- Lists for aggregating contacts
- Functions for adding, searching, updating, and deleting contacts
- Conditionals to handle various user choices and data validations.
- Additional function to export contact book as a textfile in your working folder. :)
